  In this blog I will show you how to create a personal blog site in less than
  10 minutes. We will be using an awesome static site generator Gatsby. Site
  will be hosted on Netlify and it comes with Netlify CMS so that you can
  modify/add your blogs in a matter of seconds. Also, we will add Katex plugin
  which will enable you to write math equations and PrismJS for highlighting
  code syntax.
